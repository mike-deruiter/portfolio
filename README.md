## Various Small Programs by Mike DeRuiter

## Descripton

Collected here is an assortment of small programs written by Mike DeRuiter as he teaches himself how to program & how to use Git. You can reach Mike at michaelalanderuiter@outlook.com. 

Some programs are purely "academic exercises" while others serve modest utility. Originally studying to be a Linux system administrator, Mike has a special aptitude with scripting languages, & additionally, C. Probably the most impressive program in the collection is a program in Python which implements an interpreted calculator based on a course Mike took on programming languages. There is also a flashcard-studying app written in bash, & a script that adds users to the system in bulk based on a list of names. In C, there is a program that solves anagrams as well as a clever academic exercise solving a mathematical brain-teaser. 

## Languages Used

Currently, there are programs in C, Python, sh, & COBOL (Mike took a course).
