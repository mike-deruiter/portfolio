## mhc (Mike's High-Order Calculator)

Adapted from THE UNIX PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT by Brian Kernighan & Rob Pike. A modified version of "hoc3" that adds the following features:

* Disallows assigning new values to constants such as PI
* Adds new constant ANS which stores the most-recently computed value
